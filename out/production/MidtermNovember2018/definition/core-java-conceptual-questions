Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?

A.A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.An integrated development environment, IDE is a software suite that consolidates basic
tools required to write and test software. Without an IDE, a developer must select, deploy,
integrate and manage all of these tools separately.

What is IDE?
A.An integrated development environment, IDE is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software
Without an IDE, a developer must select, deploy, integrate and manage all of these tools separately.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

A.There are eclipse , Intellij also Netbeans

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source
code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted into machine code (0's and 1's
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are: Editing the program.
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:
1.Editing the program
2.Compiling the source code
3.Executing the byte code

what is class?

A.A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

What is object?

A.Objects have states and behaviors. Object is a instance of  a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. The entry point of java application is main method .

Why main is static?
A. Without having declared main method static , your program will successfully compile but
won't execute and report error at run time. This is necessary since mainis called by the
Java interpreter before any objects are made. The keyword void simply tells the compiler
that main does not return a value.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.Object Class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. In the abstract class you are allowed to have non-abstract method which is implemented and abstract method
which is the declared only.
In interface, you are allowed to declare methods but not implement it.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

A: No,We can not,we only can declare a object as the type of Interface or Abstract class ,
then create an object , using that reference variable to get the access of these interface and abstract class property

what is Access Specifier?
A:An access specifier is a defining code element that can determine which elements of a program are allowed to access
a specific variable or other piece of data.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A:Object-oriented programming.

Abtraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user. Оnly the functionality will be
 provided to the user. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Encapsulation: This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public
methods. It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use
objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.

Inheritance:This is a special feature of Object Oriented Programming in Java. It lets programmers create new classes
that share some of the attributes of existing classes. This lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.

Polymorphism:This Java OOP concept lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts.
 One form of polymorphism in Java is method overloading. That’s when different meanings are implied by the code itself.
 The other form is method overriding. That’s when the different meanings are implied by the values of the supplied
 variables.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

A:If you omit the package statement while writing the class definition, the class name is placed into the default package,
which has no name. Java compiler automatically imports this package. Second, the java.lang package is imported implicitly.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A:API(Application Programming Interface) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK).
It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors.
We have used java.util,java.lang so far.

A:No java does not support multi_level inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A:same method name but different parameters ,that is method overloading , it happens on the compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A:In Java, an exception is an object that wraps an error event that occurred within a method and contains.
If an exception occurs within the try block, it is thrown. Your code can catch this exception (using catch block)
and handle it in some rational manner.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A:static it means , we can call that method and variable inside the class without the reference variable also , can call directly class name to call the static property .

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A:Final is the keyword , when we declare a method or a variable as final , we cannot modify that .

What is final, finally and finalize?
A:Final it is keyword , when we declare a method and variable as final ,we cannot modify it , finally it is block ,
usually using after the try catch block ,even there is exception , but finally block still can be executed , reason is
for close the source . finalize it is can do destroy the object

What is a constructor ?
A:constructor we can declare constructor using for initialize  an object .

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A:Yes We can have multiple constructors in a class.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A:The Java compiler will insert a default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A:this” is a keyword , this can represent the class itself.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A:super” it means we can use super keyword for call the superclass , property , don’t need to create a instance
for that .

What is JVM stand for ?
A:Java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A:Yes
What version of java are you using?

A:I am using java 11.0.1 2018-10-16 LTS

What is JAR stand for ?
A:Java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?

A:JVM is Java Virtual Machine, the JVM actually runs Java bytecode. JDK is Java Developer Kit,
the JDK is what you need to compile Java source code. JRE is Java Runtime Environment, is what you need to run a
Java program and contains a JVM, among other things.
 JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A:JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.It is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of
JVM.It physically exists.It contains set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime. JDK is an acronym for
Java Development Kit.It physically exists.It contains JRE + development tools.


What is compile time and run time?
A:The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.
A compiled program can be opened and run by a user When  an application is running it is called runtime.

What is heap?
A:Heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
The heap is created on virtual machine start up.

How java manage it's memory?
A:Java manages its memory by the JVM. The JVM loads the code verifies the code, executes the code manages memory
this includes allocating memory from the Operating System.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A: String is immutable, if you try to alter their values another object gets created whereas Stringbuffer and
stringbuilder are mutable so they can change their values.Thread-Safety Difference the difference between stringbuffer
and Stringbuilder is that Stringbuffer is thread safe.

What is Singleton class?
A: Singleton class is a class that allows only a single instance to itself to be created and gives access to that
created instance.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?

A:Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream .
Deserialization is the reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization

when to use transient variable in java?
A:The Java transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization process of such
class should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class.
A transient variable is a variable that can not be serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A:In Java While loop, condition is tested at the beginning of the loop and if the condition is True then
only statements in that loop will be executed.In Java Do While loop, condition is tested at the end of the loop
so Do While executes the statements in the code block at least once even if the condition Fails.

What is Enum?
A:Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants. More precisely, a Java enum type is a special
kind of Java class

What is Iterator?
A:Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java collections framework. Iterators differ from Enumerations in
two ways: Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with
well-defined semantics. Method names have been improved.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A:int is a primitive type and it size 4 bytes and Integer is reference type and its size is 16 bytes
Why is String Immutable in Java?
A:he string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.Another reason of why String class
is immutable could die due to HashMap. Since Strings are very popular as HashMap key,it's important for them to be
immutable so that they can retrieve the value object which was stored in HashMap.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A:Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
 Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors
 in same class.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A:Both serial and parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC. A serial collector is a default copying
collector which uses only one QC thread for the QC OPERATION WHILE A PARALLEL COLLECTOR uses multiple GC threads for
the GC operation

What is JIT stands for?
A:JUST IN TIME

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A:ava heap space is divided into three regions or generation for sake of garbage collection called new generation old
or tenured generation or perm space. Garbage collection is the process by which java programs perform automatic memory
management.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A:No it can choose to reject the request and it is not guaranteed.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A:Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas STACK memory is used only by one thread of execution.
Whenever an object is created it’s always stored in the heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
AReflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.
Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the
classes, methods etc. at compile time.

what is multithreading in java?
A:The main purpose of multithreading is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program to maximum
utilize the CPU time. A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run
concurrently.RUNNABLE – A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A: Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads
in Java. Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same
lock simultaneously or concurrently.

What is Framework?
A:Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of prewritten code to which you add your own code to solve a
problem in a specific domain. Perhaps you could say that the framework uses your code because it is usually the
framework that is in control. You make use of a framework by calling its methods, inheritance, and supplying "callbacks"
, listeners, or other implementations of the Observer pattern.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A:JUnit,Selenium,Rest Assured,Spock Framework.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A:Both Testing and Junit are Testing framework used for Unit Testing. TestNG is similar to JUnit. Few more
functionalities are added to it that makes TestNG more powerful than JUnit.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A:
what is dependency injection in java?
A: framework class, usually called the dependency container, could analyze the dependencies of this class. With this
analysis it is able to create an instance of the class and inject the objects into the defined dependencies, via Java
reflection.If dependency injection is used, a Java class can be tested in isolation

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A:Overloading and Overriding.
